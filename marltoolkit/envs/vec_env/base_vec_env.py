class BaseVecEnv(ABC):
    """Base class for vectorized environments to run multiple independent
    copies of the same environment in parallel.

    Vector environments can provide a linear speed-up in the steps taken per second through sampling multiple
    sub-environments at the same time. To prevent terminated environments waiting until all sub-environments have
    terminated or truncated, the vector environments autoreset sub-environments after they terminate or truncated.
    As a result, the final step's observation and info are overwritten by the reset's observation and info.
    Therefore, the observation and info for the final step of a sub-environment is stored in the info parameter,
    using `"final_observation"` and `"final_info"` respectively. See :meth:`step` for more information.

    The vector environments batch `observations`, `rewards`, `terminations`, `truncations` and `info` for each
    parallel environment. In addition, :meth:`step` expects to receive a batch of actions for each parallel environment.

    Gymnasium contains two types of Vector environments: :class:`AsyncVectorEnv` and :class:`SyncVectorEnv`.

    The Vector Environments have the additional attributes for users to understand the implementation

    - :attr:`num_envs` - The number of sub-environment in the vector environment
    - :attr:`obs_space` - The batched observation space of the vector environment
    - :attr:`state_space` - The batched state space of the vector environment
    - :attr:`single_obs_space` - The observation space of a single sub-environment
    - :attr:`single_state_space` - The state space of a single sub-environment
    - :attr:`action_space` - The batched action space of the vector environment
    - :attr:`single_action_space` - The action space of a single sub-environment
    - :attr:`closed (bool)` - Indicates whether the vectorized environment is closed.


    Note:
        The info parameter of :meth:`reset` and :meth:`step` was originally implemented before OpenAI Gym v25 was a list
        of dictionary for each sub-environment. However, this was modified in OpenAI Gym v25+ and in Gymnasium to a
        dictionary with a NumPy array for each key. To use the old info style using the :class:`VectorListInfo`.

    Note:
        To render the sub-environments, use :meth:`call` with "render" arguments. Remember to set the `render_modes`
        for all the sub-environments during initialization.

    Note:
        All parallel environments should share the identical observation and action spaces.
        In other words, a vector of multiple different environments is not supported.

    Attributes:
        num_envs (int): Number of environments in the vectorized environment.
        obs_space: The observation space of a single environment.
        action_space: The action space of a single environment.
